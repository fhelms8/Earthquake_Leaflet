# Leaflet-Challenge

Welcome to my Leaflet Challenge where I was tasked with importing Earthquake data and plotting it onto a map to show the depth and magnitude size of each earthquake. 

Here is a link to my gitpages so you can easily access it. https://fhelms8.github.io/leaflet-challenge/

Below is a screenshot of my map. 
The colors vary depending on the depth of each earthquake.
The radius's vary depending on the magnitude size of each earthquake. 
If you click on each circle, it will display the location, magnitude size, depth, and the time of each earthquake.
